AI Todo Assistant Fix Summary
=============================

PROBLEM:
- When users asked "show me my tasks", the AI was incorrectly adding this query as a new task
- This created a recursive issue where the query appeared in the task list as a task
- Result: "5. Show me my tasks - Status: pending, Priority: high, Due: None"

SOLUTION IMPLEMENTED:
- Enhanced the process_message function in mcp-server/test_agent_chat.py
- Added dual-layer protection against query phrases being treated as task titles
- Improved detection logic with keyword matching and direct string matching
- Updated system prompt to emphasize the prohibition against creating query-like tasks

KEY CHANGES:
1. Added flexible matching for view requests using keywords
2. Created prohibited titles list to prevent common query phrases from becoming tasks
3. Implemented early detection to route view requests to get_tasks function
4. Strengthened system prompt with clearer instructions

RESULT:
- "show me my tasks" now displays the actual task list instead of creating a new task
- Regular task creation still works normally for legitimate tasks
- Eliminated the recursive problem where queries were added as tasks
- Maintained all existing functionality while fixing the bug
